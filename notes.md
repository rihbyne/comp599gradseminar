# Bullets points
- You will be talking about API pagination, Database Indexing, replication, sharding

# Speaking
- Today, I am going to talk about scalable web architectures(SWA). we will be talking about distributed systems in context of SWA.Before finalizing on this topic, I had decided to present concepts in blockchain, I thought about it, I felt like to cover the whole blockchain will be overwhelming for me as well as for the audience, I have barely scratched the surface of blockchain from technical standpoint, I am still learning, its huge, exciting.

Talk about blockchain concepts here:

It has its roots in the/ or you can say - blockchain is the intersection of distributed systems, security, and databases
- asymmetric cryptography
- one-way hash functions
- Digital Signatures

distributed systems at the core
-consensus -RAFT,
- fault-tolerance

Networking
- P2P, UDP, TCP

Game theory
- tradeoffs between payoffs & incentives.

Economics
- microeconomics
- macroeconomics

# Few convincing reasons to begin understanding blockchain:

1. Its still early
2. This space doesn't have a strong talent yet
3. Much of the innovation is happening outside academia
4. demand exceeds supply
